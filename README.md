Pytorch Implementation of different structures and networks of 3DGANS for research. Voxel based training as well as pointcloud training...more to come.

Data Preparation script and Original Point-GAN was modified from the original SHAPEGAN repository found on Github. I modified the Point-Gan script to run independently.

Additionally, Mesh-to-SDF is needed for the rendering process for the SDF files.
